Included files:
- lab3a.c - Main source code file for the project. This file includes the main function as
  	    well as several helper functions to generate the required logging outputs.
	    Major functions include:
	    - superblock() - finds and parses the superblock structure
	    - group() - Produces the group summary
	    - freeblock() - Outputs the free block entry log
	    - freeInode() - Outputs the free I-node entry log
	    - ind_block() - Recursive function used to scan indirect blocks in the
	      		    directory() and file_offsets() functions
	    - file_offsets() - Scans files for data blocks and prompts recursive indirect
	      		       block searches/outputs
	    - directory() - Scans for directory entries through all possible blocks
	    - directory_block() - Outputs a directory log for the block provided
	    - Inode() - Produces the I-node summary and calls functions to generate the
	      	      	indirect block and directory logs
- ext2_fs.h - Provided header file with definitions for the basic Ext2 file system used
  	      for this project. This file is required to compile lab3a.c.
- Makefile - Makefile for this project with the required make options.

Extra research:
In addition to the provided resources on the Ext2 file system, we used a few additional
   webpages.
We used this website to figure out how to look at bits:
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2249731/how-do-i-get-bit-by-bit-data-from-an-integer-value-in-c
We used this website to figure out how to determine whether files were symbolic links, 
   regular files, or directories: http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/glibc/libc_286.html
We used this link to find out how to test for symlinks and files:
